## About The Project

I have created a milk management website that tracks the current inventory, checks on the production across the different breeds of cows that I own, determines the toatl milk sold in a given time period i.e., day week month year and then tracks the revenue generated. The website takes into account the current constant factors such as the land rate the labor costs, the cost of maintaining farm machinery and structures and miscellaneous costs that may have been raised in a day during the farm operations.
</br>The website will generate a report for any selecte time period only.
